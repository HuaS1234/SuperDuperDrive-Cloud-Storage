# SuperDuperDrive-Cloud-Storage

SuperDuperDrive Cloud Storage
You have been hired by SuperDuperDrive, which is a brand new company aiming to make a dent in the Cloud Storage market and is already facing stiff competition from rivals like Google Drive and Dropbox. That hasn't dampened their spirits at all, however. They want to include personal information management features in their application to differentiate them from the competition, and the minimum viable product includes three user-facing features:

Simple File Storage: Upload/download/remove files
Note Management: Add/update/remove text notes
Password Management: Save, edit, and delete website credentials.
SuperDuperDrive wants you to focus on building the web application with the skills you acquired in this course. That means you are responsible for developing the server, website, and tests, but other tasks like deployment belong to other teams at the company.
